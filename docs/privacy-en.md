## 1. Introduction

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data.  
This policy explains what information we process, how we handle it, and your rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Our app is designed to keep your financial information private: all sensitive data stays on your Apple devices or in your personal iCloud account

---

## 2. Data Stored on Your Device

- All financial entries, accounts, and personal notes you create are stored **only on your Apple devices or iCloud storage**
- We **cannot access** or retrieve this data
- You can delete your data at any time within the app or by removing your iCloud backup

Because we do not access this information, we do **not process personal data** within the meaning of the GDPR for these items

---

## 3. Anonymous Diagnostic Data

To maintain reliability and improve performance, the app automatically and anonymously collects a small amount of diagnostic data when it crashes or when you use certain features

### What is collected

- App version and build number
- Device model and operating-system version
- Error code or stack trace
- Timestamp of the event
- General usage counts (for example, number of active sessions)

No financial content, names, email addresses, IP addresses, or persistent device identifiers are collected or stored

### Purpose and legal basis

These diagnostics are used **only** to detect and fix bugs and to improve app performance  
Processing is based on our **legitimate interest** (Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR) in maintaining a secure and reliable service

### Anonymization

All diagnostic records are stripped of identifiers before storage. They cannot be linked to any individual user or device

---

## 4. Data Hosting and Retention

Diagnostic logs are processed on **self-hosted servers located in the European Union (Germany)**  
Diagnostic data is **never** shared with third parties

---

## 5. No Third-Party Services

The app does **not** use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or crash-reporting SDKs  
We do not transmit any data to social-media platforms, marketing partners, or external processors

---

## 6. Security

We use industry-standard security measures, including:

- Industry-standard TLS encryption for all connections to our servers
- Restricted access to servers and databases

While no system is perfectly secure, we continuously review and improve our measures

---

## 7. Your Rights

Because we do not process identifiable personal data, most GDPR rights (access, rectification, portability) do not apply. This is because the diagnostic data we collect is anonymous and cannot be linked to any individual  
However, if you believe that diagnostic information could identify you, you may:

- Request access or deletion of that data
- Object to further processing
- Lodge a complaint with your local data-protection authority

To exercise these rights, contact us at [bonsaitheapp@gmail.com](mailto:bonsaitheapp@gmail.com)

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements  
The latest version will always be available at **https://bonsaiapp.github.io/privacy-en**, with the effective date shown at the top  
Significant changes will be announced within the app
